Code for arcade controller to read arcade inputs, and transfer them to the computer keyboard and mouse equivalent.
The goal is to make this be capable of reading the inputs from the machine to the raspberry pi, and make the neccesary adjustments and 
have the game respond to it as if it were a mouse and keyboard initially. 

joyread.py is for reading the inputs from the first joystick, and convert them into keyboard presses.

joyread2.puy is for mouse inputs, and for interpreting the second joystick as a mouse.
